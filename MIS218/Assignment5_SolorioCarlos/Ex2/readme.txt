I tried many versions of "Class Library", but I keep getting errors. This is the closest I got, I think it is because of different software version?

The Error:

"The primary reference "InventoryLibrary" could not be resolved because it was built against the ".NETFramework,Version=v4.5.2" framework. 
This is a higher version than the currently targeted framework ".NETFramework,Version=v4.5".	InventoryMaintenance"
