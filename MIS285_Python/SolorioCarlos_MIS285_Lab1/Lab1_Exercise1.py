# Exercise 1 - Miles driven calculation and declared variables

num_mph =  62
num_time = 6
num_miles = num_mph * num_time
int_miles = num_mph * num_time
#The calculation works without "num_miles = num_mph * num_time", are we doing this ahead of time just for exercise 2? Or am I misreading the requirements?

# Display Calculation
print('The vehicle will travel', int_miles, 'miles traveling at 62 mph for 6 hours.')
